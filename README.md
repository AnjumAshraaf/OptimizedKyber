#  Optimized Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)

This repository provides an optimized C implementation of the [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber/) post-quantum key encapsulation algorithm, focusing on improving the performance of its polynomial multiplication operations. 
> ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This code builds upon and extends the work originally developed by [GMUCERG](https://github.com/GMUCERG/PQC_NEON). We acknowledge and appreciate their contributions to the PQC_NEON project, which served as the foundational basis for this optimized implementation.
 
The optimization fuses three multiplication routines into a single efficient function, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving overall execution speed compared to the reference implementation.
